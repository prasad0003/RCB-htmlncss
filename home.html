<h1>All-Time Top Performers:</h1>
<p>Among the players, Virat Kohli has scored the most runs (618) in the matches between these two sides in the IPL. <br>He is followed by AB de Villiers (488), Ajinkya Rahane (347) and Sanju Samson (344) .<br> Among the bowlers, Yuzvendra Chahal has picked up the most wickets (21), followed by Harshal Patel (17) and Shreyas Gopal (14).</p>
<h1>Bangalore vs Rajasthan Last Meeting:</h1>
<p>Both sides last met in Match No. 60 of IPL 2023 at Jaipur where the Royal Challengers thrashed the home side by<br> a huge margin of 112 runs. RCB batted first and posted a competitive total of 171/5 in their allotted 20 overs. Skipper Faf du Plessis scored 55 <br>off 44 while Glenn Maxwell struck 54 off just 33. Anuj Rawat played a blitz cameo of 29* off 11 as the visitors reached a total <br>of above 170. In reply, RR batting line-up failed miserably as they got bundled out cheaply for just 59 in 10.3 overs. <br>They registered the third-lowest total in the history of the IPL as RCB crushed them at their own den.</p>
<h1> VIRAT KOHLI SCORED 973 RUNS RECORED</h1>
<li>Kohli scored a record 973 runs in season 9 of the IPL</li>
<li>Kohli slammed four hundreds in the season, the most by any player in the history of the tournament
</li>
<li>Kohli is the only captain to score more than 500 runs in three IPL seasons
</li>
<p>For RCB, Kohli has consistently delivered, and he currently holds the record for the most runs scored in IPL history.<br>

At an astounding average of over 36 and a strike rate of almost 130, he has amassed more than 6,000 runs in the competition,<br> including five centuries and 44 half-centuries. RCB has repeatedly advanced to the IPL playoffs under Kohli’s direction, but they have yet to claim the title. Kohli has received accolades for his assertive leadership style and his capacity to lead by example.

During the 2016 Indian Premier League (IPL) season, Virat Kohli excelled. He served as the team’s captain for the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) and inspired the group with his outstanding batting displays. 
In the 2016 IPL season, Kohli scored an astounding 973 runs in just 16 games with an average of 81.08<br> and a strike rate of 152.03. Additionally, he recorded seven half-centuries and four centuries,<br> with a top score of 113. RCB lost to Sunrisers Hyderabad in the<br> tournament final despite Kohli’s contributions. 
Despite the defeat, Kohli received the Player of the Tournament award for his<br> outstanding season-long achievements including a century against the Gujarat Lions in 2016 and<br> a game-winning knock of 92 not out against the Kolkata Knight Riders in 2021. In the grand scheme of things,<br> Kohli’s performance throughout the 2016 IPL season is regarded as one of the best individual performances in the competition’s history.<br>

Virat Kohli is one of the most successful cricketers in IPL history and a vital player for RCB again this season.

</li>
<li>Gayle hit 17 sixes for his 66-ball 175 not out against Pune Warriors India
</li>
<li>Gayle challenged the fast bowlers to question his dominance against them

<p>Former West Indies batter Chris Gayle recalled his stunning 175 for Royal Challengers Bangalore in<br> the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2013, saying the entire cricket fraternity stopped to watch the carnage in Bengaluru.<br> Gayle likened his knock to Usain Bolt's 100m races, saying it enthralled cricket lovers and that he is glad to be part of IPL history.
